## Synopsis

- Well bash is bash but there are ways to get more info available that can be helpful at times. 
- Like having the full path displayed, Adding some colors and shortcuts to commands we use to much.
- I know they can be aliased but who ever gets the 10 seconds to do that and why should we? Why did they call `systemctl` that, for me it is an akward word to type, and it should have just been called `sysc` or `sysctl` or even `system-control`. Shorter is not always better, but if you are going to spend a long time in the terminal every day then shorter is better and creating some scripts are even better
