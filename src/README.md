Well bash is bash but there are ways to get more info available that can be helpful at times. Like having the full path displayed, Adding some colors and shortcuts to commands we use to much and they were spiteful when naming the functions. I know they can be aliased but who ever gets the `10 seconds` to do that and why should we? Why did they call `systemctl` that, for me it is an awkward word to type, and it should have just been called `sysc` or `sysctl` or even `system-control`. Shorter is not always better, but if you are going to spend a long time in the terminal every day then shorter is better and creating some scripts are even better

But for now I will jus install: `oh-my-bash`
